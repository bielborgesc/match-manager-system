# :basketball: Match Manager System
## :mag: Objective
The main objective of this work is to create a system that allows the creation of match tables between teams, through a modeling document that can be found [here](https://github.com/bielborgesc/match-manager-system/blob/master/Modelo%20de%20Documento%20de%20Modelage%20do%20Sistema%20V3%20.pdf)

## :computer: Development
With this system, it is possible to:
- Create, manage, and maintain championships for various sports.
- Organize championships and matches in groups or individually.
- Manage matches, including creation, modification, and deletion.
- Intuitive visual interface for users, allowing match simulation and championship monitoring.
- Assistance in the creation and management of championships, making the process more practical and efficient.
- Use of customizable match creation algorithm, taking into account specific championship data such as round-robin, distance between matches, and number of confrontations.
- Database structure for storing information, including data about teams, championships, and matches.

## :heavy_check_mark: Concluding
This project was carried out in my Object-Oriented Development discipline. The system is not complete, but it has basic concepts for study, and use of graphical interface using Java.

## :arrow_forward: Run the code
To execute this program, simply extract this repository to your machine and use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/) to compile and run the program.
